            <p class="planet-desc" >Despite the beautiful sights found elsewhere in the solar system, Earth remains the favorite planet for many. If nothing else, it's home to all our favorite people, places, and burger joints; unless you're an astronaut, everything you've ever heard with your own ears and touched with your own fingers has been on this relatively tiny planet. Earth's diameter spans 7,926 miles (12,760 kilometers) at the equator; it takes 24 hours to rotate once, and about 365 days to orbit the Sun once. These last two, of course, are better known as a day and a year.</p>
